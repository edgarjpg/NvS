        <h2>What Are Pterodactyls?</h2>
        <p>
          Pterodactyls (or more accurately, pterosaurs) were flying reptiles that lived during the Mesozoic Era, 
          roughly 228 to 66 million years ago. They were NOT dinosaurs, but rather a separate group of prehistoric reptiles 
          that dominated the skies alongside dinosaurs on land.

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wings:</strong> Pterodactyls had wings made of skin stretched over an elongated fourth finger bone</li>
          <li><strong>Size:</strong> Ranged from sparrow-sized to as large as modern planes (up to 40 feet wingspan!)</li>
          <li><strong>Lightweight:</strong> Had hollow bones similar to birds, making them adaptable fliers</li>
          <li><strong>Diet:</strong> Primarily fish-eaters, though some were carnivorous</li>
          <li><strong>Teeth:</strong> Many had sharp teeth for catching slippery prey</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Extinction</h2>
        <p>
          Pterosaurs went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous Period, around 66 million years ago, 
          likely due to the same catastrophic event (asteroid impact) that wiped out the dinosaurs.

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Pterosaurs were not actually dinosaurs—they were a distinct group of flying reptiles</li>
          <li>Some pterosaurs were covered in fur or hair-like structures</li>
          <li>They likely walked on all fours when on the ground</li>
          <li>Their bones were paper-thin and extremely lightweight</li>
          <li>Modern birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs, NOT from pterosaurs</li>
